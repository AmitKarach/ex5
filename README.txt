hello:) there are two folders in here:

src: contains a few java files there are 3 implemants class and 2 graph class (3 because the node class is in one of them)

WGraph_DS: contains all the build of a weighted graph incloding the node class

each graph has two hashmaps 1.repesnting all the nodes of the graph 2.represnting all the edges in the graph with anther hashmap in it each node has a row and there- he has a hashmap with each node he is neighbor with and the edge weight

WGraph_Algo: using the code from WGraph_DS here we are doing some fun stuff with the graph like checking if he is connected saving and oding graph to a file and more:) we will use here a code name dijkstra algorithm which i edited to fit to this graph this algoritem goes through every node and gives them as a tag their weight from a certion node this will help us to find if the graph is connected and what is the shortest path between nodes

we also have a test file in here with a test that checks our work:)
